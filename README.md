# Animepedia
Deployed website: (https://animepedia.fun)

This project is made for my Tokopedia's Software Engineer - Web Platform position

This site contains the top trending anime that retrieved from the [Anilist GraphQL API](https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/overview/graphql/getting-started).
Also you can make your own anime collection with the usage of [localStorage Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).

Quick notes: 
- I completed **all** of the functionality requirements, both the must have and the optional
- Used React Typescipt, React Hooks, and React Context
- Used Apollo Client for the GraphQL
- Used Emotion for the CSS in JS
